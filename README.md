## Architecture project diagrams

To be able to generate the diagrams, you will need the PlantUML https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML

Naturally, you will need plantuml binary.

Apparently there exists a vscode extension that provides preview functionality so you can see what you are doing.
